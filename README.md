# 📉 lost-history.md — How I Lost 2 Years of GitHub and Rebuilt Better

In 2023–2025, I was actively building full-stack projects, solving DSA problems, and exploring system design and agentic AI.  
But due to losing access to my Gmail, I lost my original GitHub account — along with 2 years of contributions, commits, and green-dot history.

I didn’t lose my experience. I rebuilt it — smarter, faster, and more intentional.

## 🔁 What I’m Doing Now

All my current activity, projects, and public proof now live here — in this new GitHub account.

- ✅ Rebuilding flagship projects with improved architecture and system design  
- ✅ Writing Dev.to blogs to document my journey and technical insights 
- ✅ Committing daily to rebuild my contribution graph  
- ✅ Focusing on new technologies: Agentic AI, System Design, FullStack, Microservices

## 🧠 What I Built Before

- Strong DSA problems solved (LeetCode, custom logic)
- Full-stack projects using Node.js, React, TypeScript
- System design simulations and microservice patterns
- Automation tools and agentic AI workflows

## 🚀 What I’m Building Now

| Project       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Agentic AI Dev** | Building real-world AI agents, multi-agent workflows, and autonomous apps using LangGraph and LangChain |
| **Microservices**  | Designing, deploying, and scaling projects using Node.js, React, Docker, and Kubernetes |
| **System Design**  | Practicing Low-Level Design (LLD) and High-Level Design (HLD) with real-world architecture |
| **FullStack**      | A layout simulator that maps UI components to real-world logic, scaling from startup dashboards to enterprise-grade systems |


Each project includes:
- Real-world use case
- System design mapping
- Visual demo
- Public proof (GitHub + Dev.to)

> Judge me by what I’ve built — not by what I lost.

This isn’t a reset. It’s a strategic comeback.
